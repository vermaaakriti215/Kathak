            <em><strong>Kathak</strong></em
            >, one of the main forms of classical dance-drama of India, other
            major ones being bharata natyam, kathakali, manipuri, kuchipudi, and
            odissi. Kathak is indigenous to northern India and developed under
            the influence of both Hindu and Muslim cultures. These Kathakars
            wandered around and communicated legendary stories via music, dance
            and songs quite like the early Greek theatre. The genre developed
            during the Bhakti movement, the trend of theistic devotion which
            evolved in medieval Hinduism. The Kathakars communicate stories
            through rhythmic foot movements, hand gestures, facial expressions
            and eye work. This performing art that incorporates legends from
            ancient mythology and great Indian epics, especially from the life
            of Lord Krishna became quite popular in the courts of North Indian
            kingdoms. Three specific forms of this genre that is three gharanas
            (schools), which mostly differ in emphasis given to footwork versus
            acting, are more famous namely, the Jaipur gharana, the Benaras
            gharana and the Lucknow gharana. Kathak is characterized by
            intricate footwork and precise rhythmic patterns that the dancer
            articulates by controlling about 100 ankle bells. It takes its
            movements from life, stylizes them, and adds the complex rhythmic
            patterns. Kathak is danced by both males and females; many of the
            dances convey moods of love.
